      * \ The general method of solving algorithmic problems.
      * Pillars of computational thinking:
      * 0. Work an example by hand recursively!
      * 1. Decomposition. Break a complex problem into more manageable sub-problems and fuse
      * the solutions of these sub-problems into the solution to the complex problem.
      * 2. Pattern Recognition.
      * Intra-problem similarities -> repetitive -> for or while loop.
      * Inter-problem similarities -> subroutine for efficient code reusability.
      * Branching structures -> case by case analysis.
      * 3. Data representation and abstraction. What characteristics are important and what are not
      * important -> use what kind of data structure (static or dynamic or double pointers) to keep
      * track of them.
      * 4. Algorithm. Should be as detailed as possible such that you can write out the step-by-step
      * instructions of how to solve the problem.
      *
      * For each sub-problem, we adopt the seven-step approach:
      * step 1: Work an example by hand using a pencil and a piece of paper.
      * step 2: Write down exactly what you did in the step 1.
      * step 3: Generalize your steps from 2 **to algorithm** by pattern (repetitive and branching) recognition and data abstraction
      * If you have trouble with this step, you should repeat steps 1 and 2 on different instances
      * of the problem.
      * step 4: Test your algorithm by applying it to a new instance of the problem.
      * Finding mistakes before translating to code avoids wasting time.
      * You can go back to Step 3 if you identify a **generalization mistake**
      * *Note that steps 1-4 can be done with pencil and paper and are independent of language.*
      *
      * step 5: Translate to code.
      * What if any of the lines in your algorithm do not immediately translate into one or two
      * lines of code? (If you struggle to solve a problem, just break it down and adhere to the
      * principle "from general to specific"
      * They should be abstracted out into their own function: make a good name for the function,
      * call it here, and make yourself a note about what it does. After you finish translating
      * this algorithm, go implement that function. That function is itself a programming problem
      * (for which you wrote the problem statement), so use The Seven Steps.
      * step 6: Test. Even if you have a correct algorithm, you could still have made
      * mistakes in the implementation in code,
      * step 7. Debug. Debugging is the act of fixing bugs you identified in the testing stage.
      * Once youâ€™ve identified a problem, you need to figure out if the issue is with the algorithm
      * or code implementation and go back to Step 3 (generalization to algorithm) or Step 5
      * (translation to code),
      * Remember the difference between algorithm and code!
      *
      * \method
      * step 1: find the middle node of the list using hare and tortoise pointers.
      *         For even-number long  list, left and right half are of the same length.
      *         For odd-number long list, left half has one more node than the right half.
      * step 2: reverse the second list.
      * step 3: join the nodes from the above two lists alternately.
